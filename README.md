## Description

This project is meant to be a workspace for students during distance learning in a math enrichment course that meets twice a month. The class sizes are small (2-15 students) and the goal is to both give a single space for students to be able to access puzzles and allow the instructor to see their work in real time.\
\
Students have persistent accounts they access with first and last names. No passwords are used because, due to the scale of the class and since only progress on puzzles is stored, ease of access seems like a priority.
